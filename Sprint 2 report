Sprint 2 Report, BoyoRPG, Gold Team, 58/2018.

Actions to stop doing: N/A we are actually ahead of schedule due to a desire to work/contribute. 

Actions to start doing: More uniform coding style

Actions to keep doing: Quality Scrum meetings, good code planning/prototyping, and good code design and style. We are a mature group that seems genuinely interested in our project. 

Work completed/not completed:
Implement boundaries for every map {DONE} 
Mob spawns and functionality  {DONE} 
Create a working player inventory  {DONE} 



Work completion rate:
We finished every user story
EST: 56 Hours as a team
Time Length: about 2 weeks. 
Story/Day = 3/14 = 0.21 stories per day. 

Now a pointless chart, 
(note, we excluded the extra hours we put into “early” sprint 2 due to efficiency)
