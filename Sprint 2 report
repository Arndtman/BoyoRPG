Sprint 2 Report, BoyoRPG, Gold Team, 58/2018.

Actions to stop doing: N/A we are actually ahead of schedule due to a desire to work/contribute. 

Actions to start doing: More uniform coding style

Actions to keep doing: Quality Scrum meetings, good code planning/prototyping, and good code design and style. We are a mature group that seems genuinely interested in our project. 

Work completed/not completed:
As a player I want to have defined and implemented boundaries for every map so that my movements are constricted to certain paths {DONE} 
As a player I want to see established mob spawns for every map so that I can have something to fight for every map  {DONE} 
As a player I want to have a modifiable player inventory so that I can pick and choose my armor as well as use items  {DONE}  



Work completion rate:
We finished every user story
EST: 56 Hours as a team
Time Length: about 2 weeks. 
Story/Day = 3/14 = 0.21 stories per day.
