Working Prototype Template - CMPS 115 – Software Methodology 

• Heading: Working Prototype Known Problems Report", BoyoRPG, Gold Team, 6/4/2018. 

• List of functions not working correctly (can lose up to 20 points) List all problems with your software that your team has identified. Include in the item entry the input/action that causes failure; location of fault (if known); possible action for removal of fault.

BoyoRPG.selected() does not correctly highlight selected items in player inventory.
BoyoRPG.paused() has minor interaction bugs since the selected() function is buggy. This means that the drop/equip/swap/etc functions work, but currently requires the console to see which items are selected. 
BoyoRPG.colorFix() will very rarely crash the game when it is being passed image objects to color correct. 
MapLinks.checkMapCollisions() is built from a database of boundaries. This will not cause crashes, since it’s just boundaries that are slightly off. To extend this, some boundaries may clip over others on creation to create a “third, pseudo boundary” that can cause the player to get stuck ingame momentarily such as running diagonally against a wall made of two boundary rectangles. . 
PlayerTest.Sprite.healthBar() stat text can overlap with NPCTest.NPC.talk() text. Again, this will not crash since it’s just a visual bug. 
EnemyTest.DisplayMob() can cause the orc movement animation to glitch if the player is directly above/below. This is due to the way the orc’s EnemyTest.seek() to a player.
