Heading: Release Plan of BoyoRPG for Gold Team. This is release one. Release date is June. 


(note: we weren’t sure if a release plan was required for each sprint or just the final release, nevertheless this document explains the plan for each release corresponding to a sprint as well as the actual release.)


High level goals: Develop an aesthetically acceptable RPG written in Python. For release 1 (at the end of sprint 1) we want to be able to generate a world and to be able to enter/exit worlds. After we want to include boundaries on the world's along with interactions. Next we want to develop some sort of quest style system. Finally we want to develop a final boss fight that is dependent on the inventory of the player.
